# Phileas -- what is wrong

Defects, limitations and hazards, confirmed by reading the code rather than
suspected.

**An item leaves this file when it is fixed.** It is not marked done and it is
not kept for the record, because `HISTORY.md` is the record.

**What belongs here:** something that produces a bad answer or hides a
failure, whether or not it is firing today. A latent hazard belongs here the
same as an active one, and documenting a defect is not containing it.

**What does not:** work that is agreed and unbuilt, a question waiting on an
opinion, and anything already fixed. The first two are `OUTSTANDING.md`, the
third is `HISTORY.md`.

**Honest limits are not defects** and belong in `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
section 4 as non-goals rather than as faults.

**Be careful with that distinction, because it fails toward comfort.** "Known
limit" needs a reason that is not just "this is how it currently behaves." A
real bug recorded as an accepted limit reads as a decision and stops being
fixed -- worst of all in a code comment, where an explanation of a workaround
is indistinguishable from a justification for it.

**Watch for phrasing that soothes rather than reports:** "it has not fired
yet", "latent, not active", "that is a separate concern".

---

**Two defects are recorded.** The launch layer landed in phase 1, so this file
is no longer empty for the reason it used to be empty.

**A hazard in code that has not been lifted here yet is neither a defect nor
a worry.** It is not a defect, because the file is not in this repository; it
is not a worry, if what to do about it is already decided. `PLAN.md` carries
those as hazards and schedules the work against the phases that close them.
The entry belongs here on the day the file lands with the hazard still open,
which is how the first entry below arrived.

What follows are two defects, then the two things most likely to be filed here
wrongly, and one hazard to enter the moment it becomes real.

## The external-link stub can install successfully and do nothing

**Filed 2026-09-22, when `src/external.ts` landed with the hazard still
open.** `PLAN.md` carries the mechanism in full; the short version is that
`stubOpenExternal` replaces `shell.openExternal` on the module object, which
reaches the application only if the application looks the function up at call
time. An application that captured it at startup keeps Electron's real one.
The assignment still succeeds. A browser opens on the machine running the
Journey, the recorder stays empty, and "no navigation away" reports clean
because its evidence went somewhere else rather than because nothing left.

**Why it is a defect and not a limit.** It produces a bad answer while every
test passes, which is exactly what this file is for, and it is invisible from
outside: a clean report is what both the working case and the broken case look
like.

**What is done, and what is not.** Three items were scheduled to close it.
The install-timing measurement is done and came back negative:
`NODE_OPTIONS=--require` does not reach a packaged Electron main process, so
the stub cannot be installed ahead of the application's own handlers, and the
hazard cannot be closed at its source that way. The positive control is done:
`testbed/buggy` hops its outbound link and asserts the recorder caught it.
**The other two are not built.** The exclusion list is hand-written rather
than derived from source, so it goes stale silently the day an application
adds another way out. And the independent evidence in phase 5, a check that no
foreign process appeared, does not exist, so the recorder is still both the
prevention and the only proof of it.

**Only one of those two closes this entry, decided 2026-09-22.** Deriving an
adapter's exclusion list keeps that one application's list current as the
application changes, which is worth doing and is scheduled in `PLAN.md`. It
says nothing about an application nobody has read, and that is the hazard
here. Crediting it as a closer repeats the mistake the paragraph below
identifies in the positive control.

**What the positive control does and does not cover.** It proves the technique
works against one application whose `main.js` was read. Three of three
applications measured write `shell.openExternal(url)` as a property lookup, so
nothing found so far is affected. That is not the same as the technique being
sound for an application nobody has read, which is the whole hazard.

**This entry leaves when phase 5's second evidence source exists**, and on
nothing else. Not when the exclusion list is derived, and not when the next
application also turns out to be unaffected.

## A Route that finds an endless hang can hang the Journey at teardown

**Filed 2026-09-26, when the still-responding check landed.** The check
catches a hang from the test's side: `Watch.bounded` gives up on a Hop's
action or settle wait once it overruns its bound by the responsive wait, and
the Route ends with still-responding failed. What follows is not bounded. The
fixture's teardown calls `closeApp`, which runs the adapter's `shutdown` and
then `app.close()`, and neither has a limit of its own. Against a process
that never answers again, `app.close()` never returns.

**Why it is a defect and not a limit.** The finding is made and then lost:
the Route has found the hang, and the run sits at teardown instead of
reporting it. With no Route deadline, which is the default, nothing ends the
wait. An unattended scheduled Journey stops there with no result, which is
the failure R27 names, and a hang is the finding most likely to trigger it.

**Why nothing caught it.** `buggy`'s planted hangs last six seconds, so the
process answers again before teardown and every test passes. No planted
defect hangs forever.

**What closes it.** A bounded close: give `shutdown` and `app.close()` a
limit, then kill the application's process if it has not exited, and report
the forced kill as its own finding, the way a teardown that throws is already
attached rather than swallowed. Proved by a planted hang that never ends,
behind its own `--buggy-plant` flag, and a test asserting the Route fails on
still-responding and the test itself finishes within a stated time.

## Two things that will look like candidates, and are not

Both are worth stating now, because each is more likely to be filed here
wrongly than to be missed.

**The ceiling of metamorphic testing is a non-goal, not a defect.** A bug that
is consistently wrong passes every round-trip, idempotence and commutativity
relation there is: the same wrong answer on both sides, so the relation holds.
That is a property of the technique, conceded deliberately when the design was
challenged on it, not a shortcoming in an implementation that does not exist
yet. It belongs in `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` as a stated limit, and the
answer to it is an independent test oracle rather than a fix.

**A green Journey against a working application is not evidence of a defect
being absent.** It is consistent with an engine that checks nothing at all.
Until `testbed/buggy` holds planted defects and a Journey is demonstrably
finding them, this file being short carries no weight. An absence check needs
a positive control, and the one entry above was filed by reading code rather
than by any run discovering it.

## One hazard to record the moment it becomes real

**The oracle sharing logic with the code it judges.** It produces a bad answer
while every test passes, which is exactly what this file is for, and it is
invisible from the outside: both sides agree, so nothing looks wrong. It is
not an entry yet because no oracle exists. `../CLAUDE.md` carries it as a
standing commitment so it does not get built that way in the first place, and
if it ever is built that way, the entry belongs here rather than being
reasoned about as a design preference.
